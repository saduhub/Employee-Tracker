# Employee Manager

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to solidify my knowledge of SQL. I was to build a terminal-based app using my knowledge of Javascript, SQL, Node, and Inquirer. Additionaly, this challenge introduced me to the concepts of database drivers, query sanitation, and ascii art generators. Understanding how to use mysql2 to connect to the database and environment variables, were crucial for completing this project. Note: Introducing test suites using Jest is a future focus of this project as well as refactoring the code to make use of OOP.
